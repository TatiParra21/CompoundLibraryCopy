            <h2>My name is Tatiana Parras</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer and eventual fullstack programmer. I love programming and 
                hope I can become great at it. This is one of my projects given by Scrimba. It is about the compound components. 
                I decided to use React Router as well to practice and show off my skills. I hope this website 
                ends up being good enough for a portafolio.
